# Pisten
**Pisten** (Pi + Listen) is a simple port listener that will forward valid wake-on-lan packets to the broadcast IP address. Pisten is best suited for use on always-on, low-power devices, such as the Raspberry Pi.
Some routers do not allow port forwarding to the broadcast IP address which necessitates the use of this program. Also, it is generally safer to filter out unwanted packets before forwarding to the broadcast IP.

## Usage
On linux, you can use 
```
nohup python3 pisten.py &
```
to run the server.
